**♻️ Smart Waste Management System**

A hardware-software integrated system that monitors waste levels in bins using ultrasonic sensors and optimizes collection routes in real-time.


**📦 Project Overview**
This system is designed to:

Monitor the fill level of trash bins using ultrasonic sensors.

Send data via Wi-Fi to a centralized server.

Display bin statuses on a web or mobile dashboard.

Suggest optimal collection routes for waste trucks.

⚙️ Components
Hardware:
🧠 Microcontroller: ESP8266 / ESP32

📏 Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04

📶 Wi-Fi Network: For data transmission

Software:
🌐 Microcontroller Code: Arduino C++

🖥️ Server: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (or Firebase)

📱 Dashboard: Flutter / Web App (React, Angular, etc.)

🔌 How It Works
Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to detect fill level.

Microcontroller sends data to the server at regular intervals.

Server stores data and makes it available for dashboard display.

Dashboard shows bin status (empty, half-full, full).

Route optimization (via Google Maps API) suggests collection path.

🚀 Setup Instructions
📟 Microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32)
Install Arduino IDE and necessary board packages.

Connect the HC-SR04 sensor:

VCC → 5V (or 3.3V if required)

GND → GND

TRIG → D1

ECHO → D2

Upload main.ino code (from /microcontroller/ folder).

Set your Wi-Fi SSID, password, and server URL in the code.

🌐 Server (Node.js + MongoDB)
Install Node.js and MongoDB

Clone repo and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
node server.js
Server listens at http://localhost:3000/upload

📱 Dashboard
Choose between Flutter app or Web app

Install dependencies and run locally or deploy

Displays live bin data and optimized route suggestions

📊 Features
